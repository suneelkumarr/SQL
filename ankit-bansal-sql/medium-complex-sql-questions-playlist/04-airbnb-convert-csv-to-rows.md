Hereâ€™s the conversion of the image content into the requested format:

### Problem Statement

Find the room types that are searched most number of times.  
Output the room type alongside the number of searches for it.  
If the filter for room types has more than one room type, consider each unique room type as a separate row.  
Sort the result based on the number of searches in descending order.

### Schema Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE airbnb_searches (
    user_id INT,
    date_searched DATE,
    filter_room_types VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO airbnb_searches VALUES
(1, '2022-01-01', 'entire home,private room'),
(2, '2022-01-01', 'entire home,shared room'),
(3, '2022-01-02', 'private room,shared room'),
(4, '2022-01-03', 'private room');
```

### Expected Output

| value       | cnt |
|-------------|-----|
| private room| 3   |
| entire home | 3   |
| shared room | 2   |

### Solution

```sql
-- my approach

SELECT   value, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM     airbnb_searches
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(filter_room_types, ',') AS value
GROUP BY value
ORDER BY count DESC, value;



```
